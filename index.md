I am a passionate and experienced educator with 8 years in a variety of different instructional settings from public and private K-12 schools to corporate trainning and even outdoor education. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science from Towson University with coursework in <b> <i>instructional technology, eductional theory, building curriculum, creating accurate assessments, and culturally responsive instruction</i> </b>. My passion for education goes beyond my place of work, I am often learning new things and developing more knowledge of my passions in conservationism, yoga, local and federal politics, as well as, modern psychology.
